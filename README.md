# DirectedGraphLaplacian
This function returns the directed Laplacian matrix of any graph (DAG). This is a direct implementation of the paper referred below. The Graph Laplacian is calculated using the following formula L = I - (Phi^{1/2} * P * Phi^{-1/2} + Phi^{-1/2} * P^T * Phi^{1/2} ) / 2 where, I : Identity matrix, Phi : Matrix with the Perron vector of P in the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, and P : Transition matrix of the graph. This value depends on the walk type of the graph exploration. !! Current implementation includes only a "PageRank" walk type. !! Future Implementation Plan: "Random Walk" Referred paper: Chung, F. (2005). Laplacians and the Cheeger inequality for directed graphs. Annals of Combinatorics, 9(1), 1-19.
